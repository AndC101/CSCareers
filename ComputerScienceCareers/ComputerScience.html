  <!-- introductory text for computer science -->
  <p>The most popular and fastest rising subfield of computing is computer science. Computer Science is the study of
    computation, information and automation. Theoretical disciplines include algorithms, and the design and
    implementation of software. Computer Science is a great choice for study because it teaches us how to think and
    solve problems.</p>

  <!-- some computer science educational pathways -->
  <h3>Educational Pathways</h3>

  <p>A bachelor's degree or completion of a college program in computer science, computer systems engineering,
    software engineering or mathematics is typically required for entry level jobs. Once you have your first entry
    level jobs, experience and technical skills may be more valued than your degree. A master's or doctoral degree in
    a related discipline may be required.</p>

  <p>Some options for a computer science related degree: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>University of Toronto</li>
    <li>University of Waterloo</li>
    <li>University of British Columbia</li>
    <li>McGill University</li>
    <li>University of Alberta</li>
  </ul>
