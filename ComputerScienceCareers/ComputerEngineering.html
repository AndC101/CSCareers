  <!-- intro text and background info -->
  <p>Computer engineering specializes more in the hardware side of computers. Computer engineers deal with the design
    and contruction of computer hardware and some software (i.e. processors, data storage devices, networks). A degree
    in
    computer engineering usually
    involves more electrical engineering, physics and circuit related courses instead of algorithms and software
    engineering.</p>

  <!-- example careers and difference between computer science -->
  <p>Potential careers include: Circuit designer, computer hardware engineer, robotics engineer and network architects.

  <!-- educational opportunities and future learning -->
  <h3>Educational Pathways</h3>

  <p>A bachelor's degree or completion of a college program in computer engineering is usually required for entry level
    jobs. Once you have your first entry
    level job, experience and technical skills may be more valued than your degree. A master's or doctoral degree in
    a related discipline may be required.</p>

  <p>Some options for a computer engineering degree: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>University of Toronto</li>
    <li>University of Waterloo</li>
    <li>University of British Columbia</li>
    <li>McGill University</li>
    <li>University of Alberta</li>
  </ul>
