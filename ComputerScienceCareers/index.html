  <!-- summary text for computing -->

  <p>Computing is one of the fastest-rising fields in 2023. Computing hosts dozens of different jobs with comfortable
    work-life balance and relatively high salaries. This website showcases 6 example careers in three subfields of
    computing: Computer Science (CS), Computer Engineering (CE), and Information Technology (IT).</p>


  <p>Of the three fields, computer science receives a lot of attention. This is because they are doing a lot of
    groundbreaking research in AI, Machine Learning, and other software systems that are hot topics in the news--for
    good reason! The software developed by software engineers and computer scientists are applicable everywhere to solve
    real world problems. Think of automating repetitive tasks,
    generating
    advice with AI, or detecting patterns in data! Likewise, computer engineers interact with real world software and
    hardware issues, while information technology operates in maintaining these softwares in businesses and companies.

  <h3>General Resources And Advice</h3>

  <p>If you're interested in a career in computing, take your high school ICS courses or learn to code through the
    resources below. Apply to a bachelor's (or higher) degree in CS/CE/IT and they will likely offer
    some industry co-op opportunities.</p>

  <!-- display two internship opportunities -->
  <p>Below are two (competitive) high school internships that are great experience if you're only in high school:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.queensu.ca/undergraduate/internships/qhic.php">Queens High School Internship In
        Computing</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rbc.com/en/future-launch/resource-type/programs-services/rbc-summer-tech-labs/">RBC
        Summer Tech Labs</a></li>
  </ul>




  <!-- more advice -->
  <p>If you're looking for your first professional internship, prepare your technical background. Prepare for coding
    interviews with LeetCode and make some coding projects! Any professional work experience (i.e.
    Teaching
    Assistant, Coding Instructor, Volunteer Positions) may be helpful. See below for free resources to gain
    programming
    experience. </p>
